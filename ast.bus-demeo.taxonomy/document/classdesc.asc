This table provides, for each Bus-DeMeo taxonomic class, its column number in
the spectrum file meanspectra.tab, a description of the spectrum taken
from Table 5 in DeMeo et al. (2009), and the number of asteroids upon which
the classification is based.

Class/col     Description, number of asteroids

A    2    Deep and extremely broad absorption band with a minimum near
          1 micron, may or may not have shallow 2-micron absorption band;
          very highly sloped.  6 asteroids.

B    4    Linear, negatively sloping often with a slight round bump around
          0.6 microns and/or a  slightly concave up curvature in the 1- to
          2-micron region.  4 asteroids.

C    6    Linear, neutral visible slope often a slight rough bump around 0.6
          microns and low but positive slope after 1.3. May exhibit slight
          feature longward of 1  micron.  13 asteroids.

Cb   8    Linear with a small positive slope that begins around 1.1 microns.
          3 asteroids.

Cg  10    Small positive slope that begins around 1.3 microns and pronounced
          UV dropoff.  1 asteroid.

Cgh 12    Small positive slope that begins around 1 micron and pronounced
          UV dropoff similar to Cg,  also includes a broad, shallow
          absorption band centered near 0.7 microns similar to Ch.
          10 asteroids.

Ch  14    Small positive slope that begins around 1.1 microns and slightly
          pronounced UV dropoff, also includes a broad, shallow absorption
          band centered near 0.7 microns.  18 asteroids.

D   16    Linear with very steep slope, some show slight curvature or gentle
          kink around 1.5 microns.  16 asteroids.

K   18    Wide absorption band centered just longward of 1 micron, the left
          maximum and the minimum are sharply pointed and the walls of the
          absorption are linear with very little curvature.  16 asteroids.

L   20    Steep slope in visible region leveling out abruptly around 0.7
          microns. There is often a gentle concave down curvature in the
          infrared with a maximum around 1.5 microns. There may or may not
          be a 2-micron absorption feature.  22 asteroids.

O   22    Very rounded and deep, 'bowl' shape absorption feature at 1 micron
          as well as a significant absorption feature at 2 microns.
          1 asteroid.

Q   24    Distinct 1-micron absorption feature with evidence of another
          feature near 1.3 microns; a 2-micron feature exists with varying
          depths between objects.  8 asteroids.

R   24    Deep 1- and 2-micron features; the one-micron feature is much
          narrower than a Q-type,  but slightly broader than a V-type.
          1 asteroid.

S   28    Moderate 1- and 2-micron features. The 2-micron feature may vary in
          depth between objects.  144 asteroids.

Sa  30    Has a deep and extremely broad absorption band at 1 micron; has
          similar features to  A-types but is less red.  2 asteroids.

Sq  32    Has a wide 1-micron absorption band with evidence of a feature
          near 1.3 micron like the Q-type, except the 1-micron feature is
          more shallow for the Sq.  29 asteroids.

Sr  34    Has a fairly narrow 1-micron feature similar to but more shallow
          than an R-type as well as  a 2-micron feature.  22 asteroids.

Sv  36    Has a very narrow 1-micron absorption band similar to but more
          shallow than a V-type as well  as a 2-micron feature.
          2 asteroids.

T   38    Linear with moderate to high slope and often gently concaving
          down.  4 asteroids.

V   37    Very strong and very narrow 1-micron absorption and as well as a
          strong 2-micron absorption feature.  17 asteroids.

X   42    Linear with medium to high slope.  4 asteroids.

Xc  44    Low to medium slope and slightly curved and concave downward.
          3 asteroids.
          

Xe  46    Low to medium slope similar to either Xc- or Xk-type, but with an
          absorption band feature  shortward of 0.55 microns.  7 asteroids.

Xk  48    Slightly curved and concave downward similar to Xc-type but with
          a faint to feature between  0.8 to 1 micron.  18 asteroids.
