    This instrument host is used for those datasets that consist of surveys   
    taken, usually over long periods of time, at various ground-based         
    observatories.  The VARGBTEL host is used when it is not possible or      
    practical to attempt to determine which specific observatory and/or       
    telescope was used for individual results reported.  Some additional more 
    specific information may be available in the published references cited in
    the corresponding data set description.
